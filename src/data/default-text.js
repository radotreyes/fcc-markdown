`# freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer
## Markdown goes on this panel, comes out as HTML on the left.
### Drag the gray handlebar to resize the two windows.

[See the project here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

Both \`inline code\` and code blocks are supported:
\`\`\`
const hello = function() { console.log( 'hello, world' ) }
\`\`\`

* Both types of lists work
    * Nested bullets work too
        * Just like you'd expect out of Bear or something

1. At this point I'm just gonna keep going
2. Because the project specs told me to

**Finally, here's a picture**
